# 🎬 CineTicket

CineTicket is a simple yet practical **cinema ticket and snack sales application** developed with **C# and Windows Forms**.  
It simulates a small-scale sales system where users can select the number of items such as tickets, popcorn, cola, coffee, tea, and water. The application then calculates the total price and displays it in Turkish Lira (TL).

It is an educational project that allows beginners to practice:  
- Handling user input with `TextBox` controls.  
- Performing calculations with numeric values.  
- Displaying results with `Label` controls.  
- Using buttons for actions such as "calculate" and "clear".
